day = int(input("Enter the day : "))
if day == 1:
    print("The day is Monday")
elif day == 2:
    print("The day is Tuesday")
elif day == 3:

# match day:
#     case 1:
#         print("The day Monday")
#     case 2:
#         print("The day is Tuesday")
#     case 3:
#         print("The day is Wednesday")
#     case 4:
#         print("The day is Thursday")
#     case 5:
#         print("The day is Friday")
#     case 6:
#         print("The day is Saturday")
#     case 7:
#         print("The day is Sunday")
#     case _:    
#         print("you have entered invalid number")
